1. add Tiago's sampling schemes to the genepopfilemanager classes

2. Done, gui around ne-estimation

3. Catch error from Popen call to the simulation, and show msgbox to user
	Not done but ameliorated by param checks done before Ne estimation

0. currently the warning about killing current
analyses and deleting their output is given on any click to close.  should only
come up when the  program knows there's a current run, but right now i'm not
satisfied that the life/death of the op_process attribute that, on both gui
interfaces (simupop and neestimator), performs the sim/ldne operation, whether
the isalive()  a precise flag enougth test for
the correct removal only of output files.  

1. on Windows neither sim or ne gui's can remove output files when sim/ne op is
cancelleed in progress -- get "WindowsError: [Error32] The process cannot access
the file because it is being used by another process." 

2. Done. the windows main menu does not load properly -- it displays the text
that in the unix OS's givs the accelerator keys "Ctrl+N" and "Ctrl+C", whereas
in the unix-based OS's we get the correct display of underlined N and C in "New"
and "Close" 

3.  pgguisimupop sessions output a *conf configuration file that has an entry under
section [configuration info], entry configuration_file, which currently gives
the temp file name used to run the sim -- not sure this is at all helpful -- and
can't really use the original conf file name, since the user may have changed
any param since loading it 

4.  Done. disable all controls while sim/neest in progress.

1. default to "No" button as the active one on
program exit yes/no dialogs 

2. right-click tabs to offer close -- as many of
those fx's typical to tabbed interface while doable in tkinter

3. User needs to be able to edit whole ranges in the lists in the simulation configuration file
interface

1. When cancelling ne estimation, remove temporary directories.

Mon Aug 22 15:24:42 MDT 2016
1. use try/except when starting an ne-estimation -- to catch error when
	intermediate file exists.
2. get rid of any residual tmp* directories -- probably involves keeping
	a list of these as they are created
3. skip writing a *.msgs file as part of ne estimation output
4. ne estimation output *tsv file should be sorted by file/gen

Sun Aug 28 22:05:26 MDT 2016
1. Done. use the paramater files in resources to better order the paramater controls.
2. use the current value of the parameter for the tool tip when the parm is a file name or location
	(long paths are currently truncated in the entry boxes).

1. Propogate exceptions generated by
pgdriveneestimator.py into a GUI dialog (else, as currently, the Ne estimation
fails with no clue as to reason, unless negui.py has been invoked from a
terminal, in which case the user often (but not invariably) see an error
message.  

Mon Sep 26 12:45:05 MDT 2016 
1. Move "Select" button on file/dir load
KeyValueFrame interfaces to left-of-entry rather than right.

1. Subsampling in GenepopFileManager objects is currently inefficient in that
for all individual filter sessions, all pop sections are evalutated, whatever
pop range has been specified. Need to be able to apply a pop range before
filtering individuals.

Mon Oct 10 19:40:20 MDT 2016
1. Set tab order in interface entry boxes.

Thu Nov  3 20:07:20 MDT 2016
1. Param names files, wrapped into PGParamSet objects, and used to get type and
default values plus many gui-related paramters,for the gui input of sim and ne
estimation parameters, now have so many fields that my file format (currently
two columns, the first a param name, and the second 14 semi-colon delimited
fields) should be revised to be a more regularized and readable form, such
as an xml file.
fields
2. For the todo above sept 2, number 1, should simply generlize to propogate
all excpetions into dialogs, for all the programs functions.

GUI error message when sim fails due to pop creation failing to produce pwop within Nb tolerance

Thu Apr 20 16:56:56 MDT 2017
To reduce IO costs, especially for long simuilations with many cycles, the simulation output 
should be written directly to a genepop.  I see no reason to date to retain any of the other 
files currently output (and from which the genepop file is constructed after they have been written).
I think a good strategy would be to write the data to data struct like a class, and every N cycles
update a genepop output file.

1. Add textbox to viz interface so that user can name a stats-out file.

2. Subsampling value cbox in Viz regression interface reverts to min val after 
   hitting run button, despite the user having chosen a different value (though
   the chosen value is the one used in the plotting).

1. Make ages editable in the simulation interface, such that the user can change
the value, with the result that the survival and fecundity  lists change
item-count accordingly (perhaps adding copies of the last value to fill in
additional items, when the lists are lengthened.

1. If the GUI is in full screen during a procedure, it seems that sometimes the error windows created 
   independant of the main GUI, are hidden by it, so that the user will not know that a procedure has
   been interrupted.  One consequence of using these GUI error messages, is that the console window 
   (if present) will not show the error until the GUI error windows is clicked closed ("OK").
   I wonder if there is some way to get a handle at least on the main GUI window and,
   on error, put it behind the error message(?)

1.  We need a way to show the user progress, at least in the simulations, 
because simuPOP can hang (or enter an endless loop), and the user has no
way of knowing that over time period t the simulation has not cycled at all.
Might be most simply a file with one line giving one integer, named after 
the temp_config file, and after each sim cycle, the current cycle number 
replaces the last in the file.  The sim gui checks the file during its
"sim in progress" state.

1. I need to test the nb/ne estimators correct use of input genepop files in which the loci
   are listed on one line, rather than one to a line (as is the case for all input we've used
   so far.

1. In the current Nb estimation logic, for schemes "cohorts" and "individual
   criteria", the paramters min and max pop indiv totals, are tested after the
   sampling (i.e. tested using total chort individuals sampled) and, if the
   sample is out of range [min,max] an error is thrown and the estimation is
   aborted.  We should simply skip the pop and write a message to *msgs output, 
   and proceed to the next pop.
