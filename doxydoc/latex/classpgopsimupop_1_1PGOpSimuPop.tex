\subsection{Detailed Description}
\begin{DoxyVerb}This class inherits its basic interface from class APGOperation, with its 3
basic defs "prepareOp", "doOP", and "deliverResults"

Its motivating role is to be a member object of a PGGuiApp object, and to contain the
defs that do a simupop simulation and give results back to the gui.

Should use no GUI classes, but strictly utils or pop-gen calls.

This object has member two objects, an input object that fetches and prepares the
data needed for the simuPop run, and an output object that formats and/or delivers
the results.   These objects are exposed to users via getters.  The defs in these 
member objects can thus be accessed by gui widgets when an object of this class  
is used as a member of a PGGuiApp object

The functionality in the name-mangled (self.__*) defs are from Tiago Anteo's sim.py module in 
his AgeStructureNe project -- his mod-level variables simply assigned to self.
