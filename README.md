Make a front end for ease of use, and incorporate the population genetics functions provided by Tiago Antao's python program at https://github.com/tiagoantao/AgeStructureNe.git.  

We plan on an iterative implementation of the several analyses performed by Tiago's code.  As we begin, I've committed skeletal source files to begin a tkinter framework.  Even this approach may change.  The basic class structure includes a gui class that contains an popgen (PG) operation.  This is seen in the file, preliminary_uml_classes.png.  The current strucure of the program can be seen via descriptions of classes and relationships by loading doxydoc/html/index.html into a browser.
