#List of known bugs

B1.  Running 9 simulations, 2 of them much more computationally intensive (CI) than the others, resulted  in one of the CI sims to hang.  I was able to recreate the problem on two computers (Linux) when I used the same 9 config files and started them in the same order.  On one comuter, closing the gui seems to have left the hanging process (running do_sim_replicate.py) running.  On the 2nd computer, closing the GUI killed all subprocesses still running sims. 
B2.  Related to B1, clicking the "Cancel Simulatin" button during a long simulation did not kill the process.
