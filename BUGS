#List of known bugs

Fri Jul 29 DT 2016

B1.  Running 9 simulations -- bug may be solved, but have not yet
	retested ( 2016_08_15 ) -- have added code to kill processes when the gui is
	killed, which at least should not leave haning processes.  However, the 9-sim hang may persist untill killed -- as noted, 2 of them were much more
	computationally intensive (CI) than the others, resulted  in one of the CI sims
	to hang.  I was able to recreate the problem on two computers (Linux) when I
	used the same 9 config files and started them in the same order.  On one
	comuter, closing the gui seems to have left the hanging process (running
	do_sim_replicate.py) running.  On the 2nd computer, closing the GUI killed all
	subprocesses still running sims. 

B2.  Related to B1, clicking the "Cancel Simulatin" button during a long
simulation did not kill the process.  --testing shows fixed as of Fri Aug 12

B3.  Cancelling an ne-estmation in the gui has seconds of delay before Ne2
executable stops.  Then process dies with error in the multiprocessing mod --
need a cleaner exit

B4. Fixed in pygenomics latest 20160825.  Windows -- pygenomics Controller.py
	uses a system command includeing "/dev/null", which directory windows lacks.  A
	patch using python's x-platform definition for null locations needs to be
	incorporated.

B5. Fixed 2016_08_15 -- mangled names in main menu.

B6.  Windows -- cancelling a simulation or ne-estimation process in the gui
results in windows error, "WindowsError: [Error32] The process cannot access
the file because it is being used by another process."  File locking conflict
does not occur in Linux (Nor, I think, in OSX, but will need to test).

B7.  Loading a config file in the simulation interface -- cliking the select
	button then cancelling rarely results in an update that sets the config
	file to emtpy -- hard ro reproduce, as I'm not sure of the necessary conditions.

B8.  Rare but possible -- it's currently possible to load a genepop file that's been written as
	file but not yet filled iwth data, as the sim is not yet done -- but then
	running ne-estimator on the empty or parial genepop file.  However, since the
	genepop file is written to a tempname first (named using python uuid), this
	condition is only possible if an "os.move()" command is interrupted after ther
	user has chosen the (unlikely) temp name as input, or if  such that there's a
	final *genepop name but no data yet in the file.

B9.  Total characters in a genepop file go be used as input into the
	NeEstimator must not exceed 31 characters, else the auto-truncation that
	program performes on longer names, makes the output names unrecog.  to my
	algorithm.  For now I'm enforcing a much smaller basename for genepop file input
	(18chars), to make room for the rep/generation/subsampleparam fields I'm adding
	to intermediate NeEstimation files.  I don't yet have a fix, but I have coded
	warning dialogs when genepop files for input have names that exceed the limit.

B10 Fixed 20160825 -- Windows -- seems to have resolve after revisions to
	pgdriveneestimator.py as of 2016_08_22 -- may have been change from
	multiprocessing.pool.map to map_async. 32-bit and 64-bit Win 7 (not in 64-bit
	win10) -- in GUI (therefore running using async python.multiprocessing pool),
	after invoking negui.py from powershell, then starting an ne-estimation:
	"WindowsError: [Error3] The system cannot find the path specified:
	'%SystemBoot%\\system32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0]]\*.*'  Alternatively, when
	double-clicking on negui.py, an error message that traces back to
	pgdriveneestimator.py's def "execute_ne_for_each_sample", but ends in pool.py,
	line 567, "in get, raise, self._value, TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has
	no len()"

B11 Fixed 2016_08_15, Windows success on win10 -- win10 and win7, when
	running the command line script pgdriveneestimator.py, either using "debug3" to
	run searially, or run async, terminates iwth trace back to writeGenePopFile in
	genepopfilemanager.py, line 360, def wirteGenePopFIle -- havaing been called
	from do_estimate() in pgdriveneestimator.py, line 459.  error: "IOError: [Errno
	2] No such file or directory: "  and then the files path, that begins has the
	form "_\\*filename
	-- looks like a bad path formation in the code.

B12 If any genepop file name has one or more comma
	in it, the Ne Estimation interface can't correctly parse the file name and will
	generate a file not found message.  B13 NeEstimator sometimes leaves *xTp*txt
	files after a run, and they should have a default save or delete.  B14 In
	NeEstimator interface -- need to revise the paramater/input files/output files
	check done before running.  The check for intermediate files will (redundantly
	complain about the output files existing (need a separate function to check for
	existing output files versus the intermediate files based on input genepop
	names.

B13 simuPOP thrashes when lambda makes pop size shrink to too small
	before gens are done.  On OSX, have seen that cancelling the sim leaves the
	simuPOP python processes orphaned and still working.  tests on linux, invoking
	the same thrashing show that the processes are killed.  However, Not sure if the
	OSX problem was a special case that is repeatable on other platforms, since
	exact actions leading to the instance of orphaned working processes on the OSX problem 
	are not known.

Wed Aug 31 DT 2016

B14 If you run a simulation and set "replicates" to >1, then the *conf file that is produced
	by the run will have its "replicates" param set to 1 (since the
	replicates are run as single instances, reloading simupop for each replicate).
	Using the *conf file, then, to repeat the run with > 1 replicate, currently
	requires the user to reset the "repicates" param in the interface.

Tue Oct 25 DT 2016

B15 Fixed 20161031 (difficult to confirm complete fix, but many tests show no
	more persisiting tooltip windows).  In the ne estimation gui, tooltips do not
	disappear properly when mouse moves off.  This seems to happen to (soley?) in
	the combo boxes, when the keyboard is used to select from the dropdown list,
	while the mouse is over the control, so that the tooltip reappears when the
	keyboard selection is done, but the tooltip window then will not disappear as it
	should after mouse off.

B16 Have had inexplicable hangs in ne-estimation doing cohort sampling on a
	20-pop genepop with N0 at  about 50.  Unable to consistently reproduce this bug,
	as identical interface inputs run to completion when attempting to reproduce the
	bug.

Sun Nov  6 ST 2016

B17 Fixed -- this bug was introduced recently, and fixed today.  Pre-validation
	of params in pgguineestimator.py misses exising  *_g_* NeEstimator
	intermediates, then runs and throws error when the pgdriver finds them exising.

Sun Nov 13 ST 2016

B18 Fixed -- Vertical scrolling in a tab does not re-engage after a new
	simulation or ne-estimation is created (in a new tab).

Sun Nov 20 ST 2016

B19 Windows 10 GUI (Windows 7 32-bit did not show this problem), some labels
	and buttons do not have enough width for the text. Also, in the Ne estimation
	GUI, the output file base name label runs under its corrsponding Entry box.

B20 Windows GUI, if the current focus is a combobox, the scroll wheel not only
	scrolls the whole interface (as desired), but also scrolls through and changes
	the combobox selection.
